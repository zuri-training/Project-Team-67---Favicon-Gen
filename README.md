2. **Dev Branch** : This is the developer branch which has 2 other branches;

i. Frontend: All front-end features task branches by front-end collaborators will be merge here by the assigned merger(s)

ii. Backend: All back-end features task branches will be merge here by the
assigned merger(s)

3. Tasks (Feature) branches: These branches are made by contributors (i.e team members front-end and backend) for each task e.g Signup, Landing page, history page, sign-in.

Right before you push your codes to your feature(task) branch check for any update on the upstream branch by running this command in CLI

E. Push your feature (task) branch by running this command
  Git push origin taskname e.g git push origin sign_up
  
F. Make a pull request
After any successful push, please make a pull request by moving over to team 67 github repo, locate and create a pull a pull request to the appropriate dev branch ( i.e frontend or backend) Write the changes you made and tag the assignedmerger(s) to alert them for a review on the new changes.
